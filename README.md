# AsymLIFE

*Life in Asymmetric Encryption.*

AsymLIFE is my demo Android school project using React Native, even if RN is not
officially allowed for the course (mainly because I wasn't not that into vanilla
Java :D). This app is for simple messaging with asymmetric encryption, nothing
special, though.

The name of this project was initially inspired by the brand ALIFE &reg;.
